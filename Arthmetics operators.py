# Arthmetic operatirs:
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition,
#  subtraction, multiplication and division.

# Examples of Arthmetics operator

a = 1251
b = 254

add = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b 
div1 = a / b 
div2 = a // b 
mod = a % b 

# print results:
print("this is a Arthmetics operators")
print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)

print(div1)

print(div2)
print(mod)
